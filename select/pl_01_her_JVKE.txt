Hold me close
Look me dead in my eyes
Dead in my
Til the day that i die(eyes)
Dead inside
I just wanna feel alive
With you i'm alive
With you i'm alive
Fell in love but it
left me lonely
Tried to trust but it
burned me slowly
I didn't know
what i was looking for
Til i found
her
I found her
Without her
I'm a mess
There was nothing bout that
Love that made sense
I was stressed
Til i found her(oh,oh)
I've run for many miles
Trying to find love
From a woman that could love me
And never leave my side
And i've run for many miles
Trying to get away from the
Things i'm afraid of
And everything inside
You say that"we're already done"
But what does that even mean?
You tell me to open my eyes
Thank god it was just a dream
I guess thats how you know
That it's love
When you're scared to
death they'll leave
Just say that you'll never leave
Never leave
baby
Hold me close
Look me dead in my eyes
Dead in my
Til the day that i die
Dead inside
I just wanna feel alive
With you i'm alive
With you i'm a-
Fell in love but it
left me lonely
Tried to trust but it
burned me slowly
I didn't know what i was
looking for
Til i found
Her
I found her
Without her
I'm a mess
There was nothing bout that
love that made sense
I was stressed
Til i found her
Without her
I'm a mess
There was nothing bout that
Love that made sense
I was stressed
Til i found her(oh,oh)
Til i found her(woo,ooh,ooh)
